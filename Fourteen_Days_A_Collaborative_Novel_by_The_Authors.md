Set in a Lower East Side tenement in the early days of the COVID-19 lockdowns,Â Fourteen DaysÂ is an irresistibly propulsive collaborative novel from the Authors Guild, with an unusual twist: each character in this diverse, eccentric cast of New York neighbors has been secretly written by a different, major literary voiceâ€”from Margaret Atwood and Celeste Ng to Tommy Orange and John Grisham. OneÂ week into the COVID-19 shutdown, tenants of a Lower East Side apartment building in ManhattanÂ have begun to gather on the rooftop and tell stories. With each passing night, more and more neighbors gather, bringing chairs and milk crates and overturned pails. Gradually the tenantsâ€”some of whom have barely spoken to each otherâ€”become real neighbors. In thisÂ Decameron-like serial novel,Â general editorsÂ Margaret Atwood andÂ Douglas Preston and a star-studded list of contributors create a beautiful ode to the peopleÂ whoÂ couldnâ€™tÂ escape when the pandemic hit. AÂ dazzling, heartwarming, and ultimately surprising narrative,Â Fourteen DaysÂ reveals howÂ beneath the horrible loss and suffering, some communities managed to become stronger. Includes writing from: Charlie Jane Anders, Margaret Atwood, Joseph Cassara, Jennine CapÃ³ Crucet, Angie Cruz, Pat Cummings, Sylvia Day, Emma Donoghue, Dave Eggers, Diana Gabaldon, Tess Gerritsen, John Grisham, Maria Hinojosa, Mira Jacob, Erica Jong, CJ Lyons, Celeste Ng, Tommy Orange, Mary Pope Osborne, Douglas Preston, Alice Randall, Ishmael Reed, Roxana Robinson, Nelly Rosario, James Shapiro, Hampton Sides, R.L. Stine, Nafissa Thompson-Spires, Monique Truong, Scott Turow, Luis Alberto Urrea, Rachel Vail, Weike Wang, Caroline Randall Williams, Deâ€™Shawn Charles Winslow, and Meg Wolitzer!
