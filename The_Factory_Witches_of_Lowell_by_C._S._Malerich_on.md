Overview
C. S. Malerich&#039;s The Factory Witches of Lowell is a riveting historical fantasy about witches going on strike in the historical mill-town of Lowell, Massachusetts.
 
 Faced with abominable working conditions, unsympathetic owners, and hard-hearted managers, the mill girls of Lowell have had enough. They&#039;re going on strike, and they have a secret weapon on their side: a little witchcraft to ensure that no one leaves the picket line.
 
 For the young women of Lowell, Massachusetts, freedom means fair wages for fair work, decent room and board, and a chance to escape the cotton mills before lint stops up their lungs. When the Boston owners decide to raise the workersâ€™ rent, the girls go on strike. Their ringleader is Judith Whittier, a newcomer to Lowell but not to class warfare. Judith has already seen one strike fold and she doesnâ€™t intend to see it again. Fortunately Hannah, her best friend in the boardinghouseâ€”and maybe first love?â€”has a gift for the dying art of witchcraft.
