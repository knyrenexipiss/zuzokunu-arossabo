Overview
Nestled along the coast of Massachusetts sits the quaint town of Plymbury, steeped in history, tradition, and an undercurrent of magic. Ravenna Greene is the latest to inherit the mystical Sea Glass Apothecary in this town where stars turned to glass and fell into the ocean. Local legend whispers that after centuries of tumbling, they&#039;d be used to grant wishes by a witch with one green and one brown eye. But when Pastor Chase Wilkinson arrives, he incites prejudice among the townspeople and a devastating fire that consumes the apothecary. With an unusable shop needing repair and multiple rejections after inquiring about a temporary space to sell her magical creations, Ravenna accepts a room in Chase&#039;s church. But with one caveat: no magic. Now, caught between two worlds, Ravenna must navigate loyalty to her lineage and a growing attraction to Chase. On one side, her heritage calls to her-a lineage of witches whose influence weaves into the very fabric of Plymbury. On the other side, the ordinary life she craves-far from the weight of her family&#039;s magical legacy and the prejudice of this conservative Christian community. Soon, Ravenna will be faced with a heart-wrenching choice: love or magic.
