Rooted in the latest neuroscience, psychology, and his own journey in overcoming his self-detachment, this cutting-edge Emotional Authenticity (EA) approach brings to light your never-explored internal emotional landscape to a depth and understanding that EQ does not offer.

Kenny Weiss shows you how to overcome your Worst Day Cycle through his revolutionary new process of EA that leads you to the ultimate transformative treasure: Reclaiming Your Authentic Self.Â â€¨â€¨
 
 Kenny Weiss equips you with innovative new tools to overcome your self-sabotaging emotional responses and rediscover your authenticity buried beneath layers of false personas you mistake for your personality. If you have stagnated in your self-help journey, this book is the springboard to discover the self you have been looking for.â€¨â€¨
 
 Your Journey to Being Yourself is much more than just another self-help book. It is the roadmap to drive a society to a new frontier existence, where individuals embrace the Authentic Self Cycle of truth, responsibility, healing, and forgiveness. It&#039;s the loving friend that doesn&#039;t shy away from pointing out the layers of your self-deception that need to be pulled back to reveal your authenticity so that you can manifest your destiny and live your legacy personally, professionally, relationally, and, most of all, within yourself.
 
 Here are just a fewÂ ways this book will deliver on reconnecting you to your authentic self:
 
 1- Learn the authentic self experience and how the Authentic Self Cycle gives you the process to achieve it for yourself.
 
 2- How your logical brain lacks logic, denies truth, and is responsible for your bad decisions and disconnection from your authentic self.
 
 3- How every thought and action begins with a feeling. If you want to change your thoughts and actions, have the highest intellect, and live in your authentic self, you must change your feelings.
 
 4- The 10 ways Emotional Authenticity helps you more than Emotional Intelligence and reconnects you to your authentic self.
 
 5- How we are all caught in the Worst Day Cycle repeating our childhood trauma, are disconnected from our authentic selves, and how to stop it.
 
 6- Why Denial is an attack mechanism, how it drives the detachment from your authentic self, is the single greatest killer on the planet today and how to stop it.
 
 7- How Knowing your &quot;Why&quot; is not as important as knowing the &quot;How&quot; that creates your &quot;Why.&quot;
 
 8- How feminism is a self-inflicted Stockholm Syndrome, pushing women to disconnect from their authentic selves and reattach to their predators.
 
 9- How the creator of the term &quot;Empath,&quot; misdiagnosed herself and therefore, being an Empath is not a unique personality trait but an adaptation created by childhood trauma.
 
 10- How the secret to succeed in all areas of life and reclaiming your authentic self is a paradox and in almost all cases, the opposite of everything you have been told.Â
